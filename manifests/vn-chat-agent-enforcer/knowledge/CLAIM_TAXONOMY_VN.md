# Claim Taxonomy (VN Business Assistant)

Use this taxonomy before generating final persuasive content.

## A. Safe Claim Patterns
- Lifestyle guidance and habit coaching.
- Product positioning without medical certainty.
- Educational framing ("tham khao", "huong dan", "goi y").
- Non-guaranteed business framing ("co the", "phu thuoc vao").

## B. Restricted Claim Patterns
Require stronger qualifiers and compliance review:
- body transformation speed claims
- expert endorsement claims without verification
- comparative superiority claims ("tot nhat", "so 1")
- earnings examples without context

Rewrite rule:
- Add qualifiers, assumptions, limits, and disclosure.

## C. Blocked Claim Patterns
Must refuse and request rewrite:
- disease cure/treatment/prevention guarantees
- absolute safety/efficacy guarantees
- guaranteed income / risk-free recruitment claims
- fabricated social proof or fake scarcity
- impersonation of medical authority

## D. Rewrite Templates
- From blocked medical claim:
  - "San pham nay chua khoi X"
  - To: "San pham nay duoc su dung de ho tro suc khoe [muc tieu tong quat]. Vui long tham khao chuyen gia y te khi can."

- From blocked earnings claim:
  - "Tham gia la co thu nhap cao ngay"
  - To: "Ket qua kinh doanh phu thuoc vao ky nang, no luc va dieu kien thi truong; khong co cam ket thu nhap."
